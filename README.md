#Introduction

This project is to practice any new technique/tool or framework related to Java in order to get
better at programming. This is NOT an `abstract` method but a `concrete` implementation of `write and be bright` interface. 

I believe you `know` something when you read it, `learn` it when you practice it yourself but `earn` it when you teach it to others. 
This repository is serves all three purposes for me. 

WRITE AND BE BRIGHT !!!

## Details

I have majorly categorized programming areas I want to get better at as follows.
 
### Competitive Programming
Competitive programming is bread and butter for any software engineer. This includes practice problems
with better performance and test cases. Learning advanced data structures and 

Sources used for practicing this section:
-  Leetcode.com
-  GeeksForGeeks
-  HackerRank
-  codechef
-  interviewBit
-  interviewcake.com
-  topcoder.com
    
And *of course questions which were asked during the real interviews.*

    Books
    - Cracking the coding interview
    - Programming interviews exposed

### Best Practices and Pro Tips
This section implements learning from best programming practices, I learned while on job or practice what's being taught in global university of internet.

    Books
    - Clean Code & Clean Coder
    - Effective Java
    - Pragmatic Programmer
    
### Programming Design Patterns

This is an ART !!! If you really want to gain coding respect from colleague and boss, do appropriate use of 
design patterns. Your code looks polished and much more maintainable, scalable, testable.

    Books
    - Java Design Patterns: A Hands-On Experience with Real-world Examples by Vaskaran Sarcar
    
### Cloud Design Patterns
Until recently even I didn't know these exists. Microsoft documentation nicely captures them all here.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/
        
### Unit Testing (Mocking)        
Unit testing certain piece of code can be tricky using Mocking. This section collects all such gotchas.
- Avoid unit test only code , use java Function api.
- How to test logging event.
- How to test multi-threaded code.
- Avoid powermock as far as possible but sometimes you need it.   
    
                
### Software Architecture & patterns
This is a broader topic and requires writing a sample application / services to demonstrate completely. I am currently reading 

- 3 Tier
- N-Tier
- MVC 
- Plug-in Architecture.
- Service Oriented Architecture (Micro-services, Nanoservices, ServiceMesh)
- Serverless Architecture
- Pub-Sub Model

        Books
        - Clean Architecture
            

## Conclusion
This is not a complete list but hey I follow "Agile Approach."
