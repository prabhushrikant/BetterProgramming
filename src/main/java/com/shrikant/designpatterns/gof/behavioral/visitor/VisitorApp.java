// Visitor Design Pattern
// Helps in adding a functionality to a group of classes (implementing a common interface) without changing the classes
// Advantage: Same can be done using Decorator pattern but that would require to create a decorator class for each of the classes
// Visitor pattern requires to create a visitor interface and concrete visitor class implementing the visitor interface

// Disadvantage: If we need to add a new class to the group of classes, we need to change the visitor interface and all the concrete visitor classes
